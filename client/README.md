# Repot [Client]

## Setup

There's some setup needed.
1. Create a `.env.local` file to store our environment variables in the `client` folder.
2. Add a `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID` value; this is the Github OAauth Client ID.
3. Add a `NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI` value; this is the redirect url to our `login` route on the frontend.
