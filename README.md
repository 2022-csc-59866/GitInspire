GitInspire aims to help developers to come up with ideas more easily by providing:

1. An easy interface to find a random repository on GitHub given filters such as language and stars.
2. A database generated by other developers containing repositories labeled with "tags" to easily help provide more useful and narrower searches.

## Features

### **Discover**

Visitors of GitInspire can view a list of repositories suggested by users of our applications which are labeled with "tags". To achieve our goal of helping developers come up with ideas through inspiration, we allow them to filter through our database to get searches based on what they want.

- They can filter by **languages** a repository has, the **number of stars**, and through **tags** which help identify what the repository is about.

**Alternatively**, developers can utilize our interface to filter repositories directly from GitHub, which lacks the fine-grain search compared to searching through our database due to the lack of labeling.

> A great benefit of our labeling system is that a developer can label a repository as `Abandoned` to bring more awareness to it and hope for other developers to pick it up or suggest alternatives.

### **Contribute**

With the core of our application being developers helping other developers by suggesting repositories to our database and labeling them accordingly, we allow:

- GitHub accounts with an age **`>3 months`** to suggest repositories to grow our database to help others.
- GitHub accounts with an age **`>1 year`** to create tags to help better refine the search process by giving more options on how a repository can be labeled.

### **GitHub Login**

As an application centered around GitHub and its repositories, we allow users to sign into our application with their GitHub account to help contribute repositories and create tags.

**All data stored in our database such as repositories, tags, and user accounts are all public information. You can verify it by looking at:**

- Our code for the application (since it's available to the public): [GitInspire Authentication-Related Code](https://github.com/cyanChill/GitInspire/blob/main/backend/server/routes/auth.py#L124)
- Example response from GitHub's Rest API: [https://api.github.com/users/cyanChill](https://api.github.com/users/cyanChill)

## Tech Stack

For the backend, we coded it in Python and utilized Flask as the main framework, with PostgreSQL being our language of choice for our database.

- Currently, both the database and backend server are hosted on [Render](https://render.com/).

For the client, we coded it in TypeScript and utilized Next.JS as the main framework, with Tailwind CSS as our framework of choice for styling.

- Currently, the client is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
